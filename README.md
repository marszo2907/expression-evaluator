# Expression evaluator
Demo project - it implements reverse Polish notation (postfix notation) to evaluate arithmetic expressions presented as a string.
Internal operations are preformed with a precision setting matching the IEEE 754R Decimal128 format,
and the final result is rounded to a result with a precision setting matching the IEEE 754R Decimal32 format.
